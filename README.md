## Todo List - PyThon Devs Documentation.

The logic flow of the the todolist.py application is based on a tasks.json file. This file can be generated if there is no pre-existing file. The json files stores TaskObjects that, as of now, are pretty basic, but allow for easy scaling of more attributes and complex data structures in our program. 

Control flow of program:
    validate file_name
        if file exists
            break
        else
            create new tasks.json file
