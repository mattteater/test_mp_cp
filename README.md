## About 
A simple To-Do List Management application written using Python. Users are able to view, compelte, add, and delete to-do tasks directly from the terminal.

## Design
The programs logic flow follows a top down approach where the main() function exist at the highest level. The primary control logic takes place within the main() function and uses various 'helper' functions to manage the to-do list. To keep data 
a .json file was used to store an array of task objects, with a name attribute (as string) and a completed attribute (as bool).
